The Biostar Recipes are released with the MIT Public license UNLESS OTHERWISE specified in the recipe.

Recipe authors may add their own license to any recipe like so:

    settings: {
        name: Some Recipe
        license: GNU GPL3
    }
    
The license of individual recipes may be more or less restrictive than
the global license within the repository.

Not specifying a license in the `settings` implies the MIT Public License.
