# Biostar Recipes


Life sciences are experiencing a reproducibility crisis. 
It has become unexpectedly challenging to even understand how analyses 
are performed and even more difficult to repeat the same process again.

This [Biostar Engine][engine] was designed to help scientists share, document, 
distribute and rerun data analysis scripts. We call these scripts recipes. 

Recipes are designed to facilitate 
the distribution, the sharing and the reuse of bioinformatics pipelines
