# Biostar Engine


## Where to start ?

The first step is to create a project you will be given full access to. 

To create a project, click the ```Create Project``` button found at the bottom of your projects list. 

This will open page allowing you to name your project, give it an image, etc. 

Clicking `Create` makes an empty project that you have `OWNER ACCESS` to. 

Now that you have complete access to a project you can populate it with data, collaborators, and recipes. 

We will show how to populate an empty project with these steps. 

   1. Adding collaborators
   
   2. Importing data
   
   3. Creating recipes
   
   4. Runnning recipes and gathering results 
  
  

## 1. Add collaborators

To add collaborators , click ```Manage Access``` found on the bottom of your data list page.

Only the project creator can grant `READ ACCESS` or `WRITE ACCESS` to other users.

* `READ ACCESS` allows users to view and copy what they may desire.  

* `WRITE ACCESS` allows users to: import data, create and run recipes, and delete/edit what they create.

* `OWNER ACCESS` allows users to delete/edit anything and revoke/grant access to project

The project creator is the only one with `OWNER ACCESS` to a project


## 2. Import data

Having `WRITE ACCESS` or higher

* Upload files


* Copy and Paste existing data


## 3. Make your own recipes

If you have `WRITE ACCESS` or higher then you have the ability to create a recipe in one of two ways.

* Start from scratch

    To create a brand new recipe click on the ```Create Recipe``` button found at the bottom
    of your recipes list. 
    
    This opens a page that allowing you to name your recipe, give it a picture, etc. 
    
    Clicking `Save` will create a recipe with an empty template and json file, which you can edit by clicking `View Code`. 
    
   
* Copy and Paste existing recipes ( **Recommended** )

    This is the simplest way of populating your project with recipes.
    
    You only need `READ ACCESS` to be able to copy a recipe, so public project like `The Biostar Cookbook` are treasure troves.
    
    After pasting the recipe you can edit it by clicking `View Code`
    
   
**Editing recipe code**

   Editing a template will result in the changes having to be reviewed and authorized by a staff member.
    

## 4. Running recipes

* Authorization

* Job states

* Deleting and Editing jobs

* Getting results
You can copy files from pipeline results
