      # Help

      This recipe aligns sequencing reads to a reference genome. The input data should be overlapping paired end sequences.
      The recipe makes use of tools from the BBMap software package then and aligns the processed reads
      via the BWA short read aligner. Consult the code of the recipe for the exact parameters applied in each step.

      The following protocol is followed:

      1. Error correction with `tadpole.sh`
      2. Filtering reads with `cutadapt` to keep only pairs that contains the primers at their 5' end
      3. Merging overlapping reads with `bbmerge.sh`
      4. Aligning merged reads with the `bwa` aligner.
      5. Filtering the alignments for unique, primary hits that are over a minimal length.
      6. Generating a summary table with the percent hit to each sequences across each sample.

      Produces a heatmap of the aligned sequences relative to the various sequences in the file.

      # Parameters

      1. Input data collection in FASTQ format.
      2. Reference genome sequences in FASTA format.
      3. A sample sheet in CSV format that describes the primers for each sample.

      # Requirements

      For paired end reads, naming should be such that after sorting by filename the pairs follow one another
      with the first in pair coming first.

      # Results
      1. Combined count report
      2. Combined percent report and heatmap visualization.
      3. Aligned bam files in the `results/bam` folder.
      4. Per-sample alignment statistics `results/counts/` folder.
