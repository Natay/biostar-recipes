      Align short reads with different methodologies: bwa, bowtie2, hisat2
      # Help

      This recipe aligns sequencing reads to a reference genome.

      There is the option to select different software and to subselect  1 percent or 10 percent of the sequencing reads.

      # Parameters

      1. Input data collection in FASTQ format.
      2. Reference genome sequence in FASTA format.

      # Requirements

      For paired end reads, naming should be such that after sorting replicates group together.

      # Results

      1. Aligned bam files in the `bam` folder.
      2. Alignment statistics in the `flagstat.txt` and `idxstats.txt` files.
