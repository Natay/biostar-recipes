        # Purpose

        This project contains commonly used data analysis recipes.

        Each analysis recipe has results associated with it.

        # Analyses

        You may copy any of these recipe into your own projects.

        # Data

        Each analysis also comes with test data that is also deposited into this project.

        Investigate the data and the results to understand the recipe requirements.
