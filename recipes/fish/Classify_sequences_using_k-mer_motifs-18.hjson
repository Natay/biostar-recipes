      # Help

      Centrifuge is a microbial classification software that enables rapid, accurate,
      and sensitive labeling of reads and quantification of species.

      This recipe will execute the Centrifuge software and classify against a database created from
      a custom FASTA file.

      A requirement of the custom FASTA file is that it must label the sequences by their accession number.

      The resulting datasets are text reports listing the percent abundance for each species
      that that was found in the sample:

      ```

      ...
      ```

      A different section is generated at each taxonomic rank.

      The following visualizations are generated:

      1. A heatmap of the percentages at the species level.
      2. A rarefaction curve for each of the samples.

      ## Input files

      1. A directory that contains all the datafiles.
      2. A sample sheet that connects the read pairs to file names
      3. A reference file that contains the genomic sequences for the sequences that should be classified against.

      Users may view the sample input files for more information on the precise file formats.
