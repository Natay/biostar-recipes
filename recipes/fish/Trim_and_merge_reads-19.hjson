      '''
      Performs primer removal, quality trimming and merging of paired end reads.

      # Help

      This recipe performs data processing of a paired end read collection.
      Data processing is carried out in the following order.

      1. Trim reads by quality
      2. Trim reads of forward and reverse primer sequences.
      3. Merge trimmed read pairs.
      4. Filter out reads with Ns.
      5. Size select reads.

      # Input

      This recipe requires a paired end data collection and a sample sheet.
      The format of the sample sheet is shown below.

      ```
      sample,sample_group,barcode,fwd_primer,rev_primer,target_gene,read1,read2
      S1,MiniX,ATCACG,GCATTYCCNCGDATRAAYAAYATRAG,ACCTCAGGGTGTCCGAARAAYCARAA,COI,S1_R1_001.fastq.gz,S1_R2_001.fastq.gz

      ```

      # Output

      Final results are in `selected` folder. The processed data at each step is organized as follows.

      1. Trimmed paired end reads in trimmed directory.
      2. Merged reads after trimming in merged directory.
      3. Reads filtered for Ns in filtered directory.
      4. Size selected reads in selected directory.
