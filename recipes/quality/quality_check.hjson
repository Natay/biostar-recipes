    name: Improve the quality of sequencing reads
    image: quality_check.png
    summary: Improves the quality of sequence reads by trimming low quality reads and/or adapter. Performs sliding window trimming followed by an optional adapter trimming step.
    help:
    '''

    #Help
    This recipe is used for pre-processing of sequencing reads.
    The data obtained from the sequencer can have poor quality or technical sequences (like adapters).
    Removing those sequences can improve the downstream analysis.
    This recipe can be used to remove those poor quality sequences and/or adapter sequences from sequencer.

    #Parameters:
    1. Group or no-group for fastqc analysis.
    2. Single end reads or Paired end reads.
    3. Threshold quality score.
    4. Minimum length of reads
    5. Window size for trimming.
    6. Adapter type for adapter removal.


    #Output
    1. Fastqc report of sequence(s) before quality control in folder fastqc_reports.
    2. Trimmed Reads
    3. Fastqc report of sequence(s) after quality control inside the output folder within fastqc_reports_after_trimming.
